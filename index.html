                This website displays a list of active businesses in your local area.
                If zip code is not an important factor for your job seeking, you can simply click search 
                and a full list of jobs will be available to you. The businesses listed gives you a slight 
                description of what they specialize in and where they are located. You can utilize this
                data to seek a job that you would like to participate in and find a job in an area that
                best suits you.
